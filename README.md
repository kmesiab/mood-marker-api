# Mood Marker API 🃏

**The Mood Marker API is a powerful, lightweight Natural Language
Processing (NLP) API** tailored for seamless integration and deployment on AWS.

It offers a suite of endpoints for conducting essential NLP tasks, including
sentiment analysis and Named Entity Recognition (NER), designed to enhance
your applications with the capability to understand and interpret the
emotional and factual content of text data.

## 🚀 Analyze Sentiment

To perform sentiment analysis, use the curl command as follows:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost/sentiment -d "text=this is text to be analyzed"
```

This endpoint expects a form `POST` with the `text` field containing the text
you wish to analyze. It returns a detailed JSON object with the original text,
a comprehensive VADER sentiment score, and emotion scores to quantify the
sentiment of the input text accurately.

Example of a successful response:

```json
{
  "emotion_scores": {
    "anticipation": 1,
    "joy": 3,
    "positive": 5,
    "surprise": 1
  },
  "text": "Despite the grey skies, John and Maria's wedding in Seattle was filled with joy, laughter, and an overwhelming sense of love, truly a heartwarming event.",
  "vader_emotion_scores": {
    "compound": 0.952,
    "neg": 0.031,
    "neu": 0.509,
    "pos": 0.461
  }
}
```

Errors will be returned in the following format:

```json
{
  "error": "No body found in the request."
}
```

## 🚀 Extract Named Entities

To extract named entities from text, use the following curl command:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost/ner -d "text=this is text to be analyzed"
```

This endpoint accepts a URL Encoded Form post with the `text` property set
to the text you wish to analyze for entities. It returns a JSON object
containing the identified entities, enhancing your text's understanding.

Example response:

```json
{
  "named_entities": [
    {
      "label": "PERSON",
      "text": "John"
    },
    {
      "label": "PERSON",
      "text": "Maria"
    },
    {
      "label": "GPE",
      "text": "Seattle"
    }
  ],
  "text": "Despite the grey skies, John and Maria's wedding in Seattle was filled with joy, laughter, and an overwhelming sense of love, truly a heartwarming event."
}
```

Errors will follow this format:

```json
{
  "error": "No body found in the request."
}
```
